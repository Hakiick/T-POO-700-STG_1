# TimeManager

To start the project:

- Run `docker-compose -p time-manager -f docker-compose.yml up`

Now you can visit [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) from your browser.

## Details

the developement server requires a .env with OVH login for the SMTP server to work

or you can visit the production server where everything should work, at [`time-manager.kwer.fr`](https://time-manager.kwer.fr)

Here's the login for a general manager :

```
email: alice@example.com
password: alice@example.com
```
